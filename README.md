# Tower Defense Game
Welcome to Rampart Defenders! A fully functional Tower Defense game built in C++ using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) framework. This solo project features original gameplay mechanics as well as the classic tower defense style mechanics.

- **Multiple Tower Types**  
  Offensive and support towers, each with unique behavior, damage, range, and upgrade paths.
- **Enemy Waves**  
  Gradually scaling waves of enemies with distinct movement patterns and increasing difficulty.
- **Resource Management**  
  Earn and spend in-game currency to place, upgrade, and strategically position towers.


## Visuals

## Sound Effects
